# voting-final-project
Virtual Election Booth: This project implements the secure election protocol 
for voting with two central facilities. These two facilities are CLA and CTF.
Our goal is to make the voting process as secure as possible to maintain individual
privacy and prevent cheating. Thus, we must implement signatures and AES keys to
encrypt and decrypt for the user.
